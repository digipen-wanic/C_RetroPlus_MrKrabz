* Nico's Guide and TODO list for finishing Donkey Kong 
  or, why merge conflicts should terrify you
* Things for Frank to do 
** Tweaks
*** TODO Ladders
    - [ ] Going down ladders
      For this, just change the player's layer to one that doesn't collide with
      platforms, then restore it.
    - [ ] Barrels going down ladders
      Similar to the player, but look at the fireball code for an example of how
      to randomly pick whether they descend.
    - [ ] Playing animation when ascending ladders
** TODO Death animation
   Mario needs to play a death animation
** TODO Starting barrel throw animation 
   Could also be done by Daron
** TODO Keys 
   Reassign the left, right, up, and down keys from WASD to the arrow keys
** Plus Content 
*** TODO Setting up next level
    Once the main level is totally done, copy it and paste it, renaming it to
    =PlusLevel.unity=. The player will now proceed to it after winning the game.
*** TODO Setting up the enemies
    - Drag the prefab =EnemyBarrel= onto the barrel prefab variable on Donkey
      Kong. Open the prefab and set the enemy sprite to the new one.
* Things for Frank or Jacob to do
** TODO Adjust animation timing
   - [ ] Oil tank burning
   - [ ] Adjust Donkey Kong throw timing
** TODO Fix ladder placement 
   Need updated ladders from Frank that weren't pushed
* Things for Jacob to do
** TODO Adjust timers
   - [ ] Time between fireball spawns
   - [ ] Length of DK animation/Throw offset
** TODO Adjust fireball spawn point 
   Move the GameObject within the OilTank named FSpawnPoint
** TODO Adjust main menu scaling
   Adjust the camera size, not any other sizes
** TODO Adjust fireball spawn time 
   =Delay= on =OilTank=
** TODO Add headers to all files 
   Should be in the following format:
#+BEGIN_SRC
/*****************
 * By AUTHORS 
 * Purpose: DESCRIPTION
*****************/
#+END_SRC
** TODO Make sure all animations play correctly
* Things for me to do before I leave
** TODO Fix fireball climbing
** TODO Jump animation
* Cloning the repo 
  - Open git bash
  - Type =cd /c/Users/MYDIGIPENUSERNAME/Documents=
  - Type =git clone https://github.com/digipen-wanic/C_Retroplus_mrkrabz=
  - Type =cd C_Retroplus_mrkrabz=
* Committing and push cheat sheet
  Anything =like this= indicates a command to be typed into the Git Bash prompt.
** If you don't already have it open: 
   - Open it by typing Git Bash into the start menu
   - =cd /c/Users/MYDIGIPENUSERNAME/Documents/c_retroplus_mrkrabz=
** Once it is open:
   - =git pull=
     Here, if you see *merge conflicts* or *overwritten*, stop what you are
     doing and:
     - =git merge --abort=
     - After finishing the normal commit, type =git pull= again and follow the
       instructions [[*If you ever see the words *merge conflicts*][here]].
   - =git add *=
   - =git commit -m "COMMITMESSAGE\"=
   - =git push=
     Authenticate here with your GitHub username and password, pressing enter
     after each one. Don't type into the web prompt with the logo, only the
     plain text one.
* Adjusting animation times
  I've left some animation speed time adjustments. Here's how you do this:
** If it's adjusting an animation's speed
   - Find the animation in the project view
   - Select it
   - Hit Ctrl-6 to open the animation pane
   - Drag each keyframe to match the right speed. The timestamps along the top
     are in the format of: SECONDS:FRAMES. Check the mario run animation for an
     example of an animation whose sprite changes every 6 frames.
** If it's adjusting the timing of a script-based animation
   Depending on the script, you should see a variable named =somethingTime=,
   which controls how long before something happens.
* If you ever see the words *merge conflicts* 
  This is a very bad thing. Steps to fix:
  Check the files listed as having merge conflicts. If one is a:
    - .meta:
      - Just delete the file.
    - .unity:
      - Allocate around 30 minutes for fixing this. This could be a doozy. You
        may want to talk to Ryan, or possibly Blake, as he has some limited
        experience with git.
      - Type =git log=
      - Find the hash of the most recent commit on your end. Copy it. It should
        look like =da0e05d00c46ed3b15a4ca44a777e22860c70dcb=.
      - Type =git checkout <HASH>=
      - Type =git checkout -b merges=
      - Type =git log=
      - Find the most recent hash that says origin/master on it. Copy its hash.
      - Type =git checkout <REMOTEHASH>=
      - Open the scene in unity. Copy anything you want to keep from it.
      - Type =git checkout merges=
      - Open the scene. Paste in everything that should be kept.
      - Save.
      - Type =git add *=
      - Type =git commit -m "Fix merge conflicts"=
      - Type =git branch -d master=
      - Type =git branch -m merges master=
      - Type =git push --force=
      - Berate *someone*.
    - anything else:
      - Open the files and manually delete all the weird-looking stuff that is
        old and unwanted until it works again. Then, run:
        - =git add *=
        - =git commit -m "Merge branches"=
        - =git push=
    If it absolutely cannot be resolved, type =git merge --abort=
* Final turn-in 
  Build Settings
  - Go to Edit>Project Settings>Player
  - Make sure that:
    - Default is Native Resolution is unchecked
    - Default Screen Width and Height and 512 and 448 respectively
    - Display Resolution Dialog is unchecked
  Turn in both the compiled executable and the entire git repository, zipped by
  right-clicking on it and hitting Send To>Compressed Archive
* Other common issues 
** If animations look weird
   Add a 1pixel transparent border around every sprite in the spritesheet
** If sprites are blurry 
   Click on the sprite in project view, and change filtering mode to point.
   Click apply.
* Who to go to for help 
  - Ryan
  - For git issues, Blake might be able to help you. He's on one of the metroid
    teams.
  - If you absolutely need my help with something that I could answer over
    discord without access to a full PC, I can respond until around 6AM Thursday
    and after around 8AM Friday, but don't count on it.
